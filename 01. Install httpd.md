If firewalld is running and active, it will block httpd server. Hence check firewalld status and stop it using the following commands.
```sh
  #systemctl status firewalld
  #systemctl stop firewalld
```

You can start, stop, enable and check the status of httpd server using the following commands
```sh
  #systemctl status httpd
  #systemctl start httpd
  #systemctl stop httpd
  #systemctl enable httpd
```
