# Install httpd
```sh
  #yum install httpd
  #cd /etc/httpd
  #cd conf
  #vi httpd.conf

DocumentROOT is /var/www/html directory. Create index.html file in this directory.

If firewalld is running and active, it will block httpd server. Hence check firewalld status and stop it using the following commands.
```sh
  #systemctl status firewalld
  #systemctl stop firewalld
```
